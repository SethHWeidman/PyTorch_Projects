Projects for learning Pytorch

## dcgan

Implementation of DCGAN in PyTorch. Original GitHub [here](https://github.com/diegoalejogm/gans).

Note: uses the same architecture and hyperparameters as the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). Hence, one "gotcha" is that it starts by resizing the images to be 64x64, even though MNIST digits are normally 28x28.

## time_series

Ports of Jason Brownlee's tutorials on using LSTMs for time series modeling, originally written in Keras.
